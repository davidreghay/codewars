# codewars

A public space for all of my solutions to kata offerings on <a href="http://codewars.com">codewars</a>.  Under each language directory are my solutions in those languages and a README.md file referencing the relevant page for each kata.

```ruby
if(you.like_programming?)
  loop do
    self.practice_kata
    break if self.tired_or_hungry?
  end
end
```
